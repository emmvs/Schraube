# 🧠 EXERCISE: "What is your Name?"
# --------------------------------------------
# GOAL:
# Write a program that:
# 1️⃣ Asks the user for their first, middle, and last name
# 2️⃣ Combines them into one full name
# 3️⃣ Prints a friendly message with that full name
#
# ⚠️ You must use a method to compute the full name.
# ⚠️ Use string interpolation (#{}) instead of + for combining.
#
# --------------------------------------------
# 💡 HINTS & CLUES (no answers!)
# --------------------------------------------

# 💬 How to talk to the user
# Use puts to ask questions.
# Example: puts "What’s your first name?"

# 🧏‍♀️ How to listen to the user
# Use gets.chomp to capture what they type in.
# Example: first_name = gets.chomp

# 🧩 Methods
# Define a method (e.g. compute_name) that takes arguments like:
# def compute_name(first_name, middle_name, last_name)
#   # something goes here
# end
#
# Then call it later and pass your variables in.

# 🪄 String Interpolation
# Use "#{variable}" inside double quotes to mix text and Ruby values.
