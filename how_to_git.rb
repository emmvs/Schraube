# GIT & GITHUB – Quick Notes
# -----------------------------

# 1️⃣ git init
# Turns your folder into a Git repository (starts tracking changes)
# Think of it like “activate version control/tracking here”

# 2️⃣ git add <file>
# Adds all changed files to the "staging area" (like prepping them for a photo)
# You can also add specific files: git add schraube.rb

# 3️⃣ git commit -m "Some more notes about method"
# Saves a snapshot of your changes with a message
# Use short, clear commit messages that explain *why* you changed something.

# 4️⃣ gh repo create --public --source=.
# Creates a new **GitHub repository** from your current folder (the dot means “this one”)
# `--public` means anyone can see it
# You’ll need to log into GitHub CLI once before using this command
